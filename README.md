# BMI Calculator: a body mass index calculation app

'BMI Calculator' is a command-line-interface (CLI) health app hosted as an app on Heroku, written in Python.

## Purpose 
The objective of this app is to provide the user with a guidence to reach and maintain healthy body weight. Through calculation of
body mass index, the application will update the user about the current body weight range and let's the user track the changes over 
time.

## Requirement Gathering and Planning

Before starting the coding for this project, I took the time to think about how to set up the architecture of this app, the layout of the output on the console and the functionality required to provide a good user experience. As the CI study material advised, I kept it simple,
and I tried to follow a 'linear' logic.

### User Demographics, Stories and Needs

#### Target Demographic
This app is useful for anyone wanting to track and control their finances regardless of age, income or profession. Some examples of such people are: 

- Students: this group of people tend to be younger, have a smaller budget and just starting to manage their own finances. Keeping track to avoid overspending would be useful to them.
- Families: multiple adults working from a single budget with a wide variety of expenses including childcare, may need to keep a close eye on their finances to ensure that their outgoings don't exceed their income.
- Debt repayers: people who are trying to actively reduce their debt such as student loans or credit card debts, benefit from the use of this app because they can manage their spending to ensure they have enough for a payment against their debt at the end of the month.
