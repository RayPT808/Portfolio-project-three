# BMI Calculator: a body mass index calculation app

'BMI Calculator' is a command-line-interface (CLI) health app hosted as an app on Heroku, written in Python.

## Purpose 
The objective of this app is to provide the user with a guidence to reach and maintain healthy body weight. Through calculation of
body mass index, the application will update the user about the current body weight range and let's the user track the changes over 
time.

## Requirement Gathering and Planning

Before starting the coding for this project, I took the time to think about how to set up the architecture of this app, the layout of the output on the console and the functionality required to provide a good user experience. As the CI study material advised, I kept it simple,
and I tried to follow a 'linear' logic.
